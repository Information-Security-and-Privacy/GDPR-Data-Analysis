# GDPR-Data-Analysis
Analysis on how much of our personal information are we giving out to the world unknowingly

Different companies know a lot about you.  If anyone else gets unauthorized access to this data, they can know a lot about you as well.  The goal of this assignment is to find out what information you are providing to companies so that you can decide for yourself if you want to take steps to secure it.  

As per the GDPR, individuals can get access to their data from a given firm.  In this assignment, you will be requesting your user data from 10 applications/websites that you commonly use and submitting a report on your findings.  

Submit a 1 page PDF that details 
The companies from which you requested the data and how you did it.  (See below for examples)  If you have a type of company that you do not want to name in your report, such as a pornographic or dating site, you may omit them.
What did you learn by looking at the data? Was there anything unexpected in the data being collected? 
How does the data collected differ from company to company? (eg. apple facetime vs google hangouts)  Does this seem to change based upon how the company makes money?
Is there anything you plan to change about the data which you provide to companies?
Does the company have a way on their website to allow California residents to opt out from their data being monetized?
